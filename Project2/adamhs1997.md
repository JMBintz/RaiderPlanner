For this project, we continued work on https://github.com/gzdwsu/RaiderPlanner/issues/2. 
We essentially continued work on the issue to improve the existing chat system. I worked 
on this with issue again with L. Gauldin. While the goal of our first project submission
was to add a simple chat client and server, the goal this time around was to add the 
ability to have multiple clients connect to the server. Now, multiple users can chat on
the same chat server instance, allowing for a more group-oriented chat experience. I created
a base for the multiple-thread, multi-client server in the existing ServerMain.java (in
/src/edu/wright/cs/raiderserver). Lucas split the threading code out into separate 
ServerHandler and Client files. From there, we went back and forth on different 
implementations that did not have concurrency errors. Lucas was the one to find the final
implementation that allowed for multiple clients with no threading-related issues.

I made a total of 6 commits to work on this issue. These include:
*48baaae Start framework for multiple clients
*6391248 Fix IO for one client
*1cbc840 Read input from multiple clients
*fcf21b5 Let server send msg to all clients
*a2a714a Add back in separate read/write threads
*ca591a7 Fix message passing between clients
The details of these commits can be seen in the pull request at 
<todo insert url>. Note that this pull request would merge the feature development branch
back into the project master branch, rather than pulling the code all the way into the
gzdwsu repository. This is not the complete chat client/server code, and more functionality
will be added in the third project submission. I feel that each of these commits was 
descriptive and appropriate for each code addition. As we were able to implement a 
functional chat client with multiple clients stemming from these commits, I believe these
were positive changes to RaiderPlanner.
